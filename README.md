## Project Name: CarGenie

### Project Description:
CarGenie is an AI-powered tool designed to help drivers diagnose and resolve minor automotive issues in real time, especially in remote areas where repair services are unavailable. The system leverages multimodal large language models to identify common car issues based on user queries such as warning signs or unusual noises.

CarGenie provides step-by-step, voice-guided troubleshooting and repair instructions for general problems.

If the issue is more complex, CarGenie connects drivers to nearby roadside assistance services, providing real-time updates on the location and estimated time of arrival (ETA).
